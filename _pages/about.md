I am migrating my old website, so I will be adding more of my activities over time.

I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at Berkeley. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a pre-doc on forced displacement topics in Jordan and Kenya under Edward Miguel (Berkeley) and Sandra Rozo (World Bank), and on urbanization in Jordan under Nick Tsivanidis (Berkeley).

Prior to that and as part of my master’s thesis in Agricultural Economics at McGill University, I worked with Aurelie Harou (McGill), Marshall Burke (Stanford), and David Lobell (Stanford) on assessing the effects of relaxing credit and information constraints on agricultural productivity in Tanzania. Finally, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics (with Distinction) from the American University of Beirut.
