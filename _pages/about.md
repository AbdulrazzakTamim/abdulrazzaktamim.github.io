I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. My research lies at the intersection of Environmental and Development Economics, with two main areas of focus: the efficient and equitable allocation of scarce resources and the integration of forcibly displaced populations.

I employ experimental methods, economic theory, and large datasets to examine how policy interventions can improve welfare in developing countries.

Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:atamim@berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atamim@berkeley.edu</a> if you have any questions!
