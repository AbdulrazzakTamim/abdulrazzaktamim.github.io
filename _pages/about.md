I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at Berkeley interested in Development Economics. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a pre-doc on forced displacement topics in Jordan and Kenya under [Edward Miguel](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley) and [Sandra Rozo](https://www.sandrarozo.net/) (World Bank), and on urbanization in Jordan under [Nick Tsivanidis](https://www.nicktsivanidis.com/) (Berkeley).

Prior to that and as part of my master’s thesis in Agricultural Economics at McGill University, I worked with [Aurelie Harou](https://aurelieharou.com/) (McGill), [Marshall Burke](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/) (Stanford), and [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) (Stanford) on assessing the effects of relaxing credit and information constraints on agricultural productivity in Tanzania. Finally, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics _(with Distinction)_ from the American University of Beirut.
