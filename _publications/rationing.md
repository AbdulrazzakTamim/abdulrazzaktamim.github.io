I develop a structural model of urban water allocation under capacity constraints to compare the welfare effects of rationing by intermittent supply, uniform quotas, and efficient pricing. I find that while quotas generate allocative inefficiency by failing to account for preference heterogeneity, intermittency imposes substantial technological costs by forcing households to invest in adaptation strategies. I recover the model's structural primitives using the universe of meter-level billing data from Amman, Jordan, combined with a novel survey quantifying the costs of intermittency. To identify the parameters governing adaptation costs, I leverage a geographic regression discontinuity design that exploits exogenous spatial variation in supply duration.
