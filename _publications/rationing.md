**The Problem.**
How do we distribute essential resources when supply is fixed and prices are regulated? Traditional rationing (intermittent supply) creates hidden inefficiencies. I analyzed how alternative market designs -- such as flexible pricing or capacity quotas -- could improve efficiency and equity.

**The Approach.**
* **Causal Inference:** Leveraged a spatial discontinuity (natural experiment) in the supply network to identify causal effects.
* **Structural Modeling:** Built an equilibrium model of household demand to estimate hidden user costs (shadow prices) that administrative data misses.
* **Large-Scale Data:** Processed the universe of meter-level billing data (900k+ users) combined with novel survey data.

**Key Findings.**
* **The "Reliability Tax":** The status quo of intermittent supply acts as a regressive tax. Low-income users spend a disproportionate share of expenditure on private storage technology to cope with unreliability.
* **Policy Counterfactuals:** Simulations show that transitioning to **market-clearing prices** or **quotas** would reduce the welfare loss, effectively "refunding" the wasted storage costs back to consumers.
